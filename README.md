# ETMO:Evolutionary Transfer Multiobjective Optimization
To promote the research on ETMO, benchmark problems are of great importance to ETMO algorithm analysis, which helps designers or practitioners to better understand the merit and demerit of ETMO algorithms. However, although there are many areas that ETMO can cover, there are few types of benchmark problems that exist. Thus, a new test function suite (called ETMOF) is designed here, covering diverse types and properties in the case of multi-task, such as various formulation models, various PS geometries and PF shapes, large-scale variables, dynamically changed environment, etc. Specifically, the proposed test suite has 40 benchmark problems, which can be classified as the following five types:
  
  (1)	Multitask Multiobjective Optimization Problems: ETMOF1 to ETMOF8;
  
  (2)	Multitask Many-objective Optimization Problems: ETMOF9 to ETMOF16;
  
  (3)	Multitask Large-scale Multiobjective Optimization Problems: ETMOF17 to ETMOF24;
  
  (4)	Many-task Multiobjective Optimization Problems: ETMOF25 to ETMOF32;
  
  (5)	Multitask Dynamic Multiobjective Optimization Problems: ETMOF33 to ETMOF40;

The detail definitions of these 40 benchmark problems can be found in technical report, which can be downloaded in https://www.scholat.com/vpost.html?pid=160180, and all benchmark functions have been implemented in JAVA code.
